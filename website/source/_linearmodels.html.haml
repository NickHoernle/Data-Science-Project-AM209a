%p Partially inspired by the prediction methods of the TripAdvisor guest speaker, we created content-based linear models in which we created a matrix with dummies for all of the categorical restaurant information given by Yelp. We then trained a lasso regression on these predictors with stars as the target variable to determine the most informative categorical predictors. When running this model on new data, we achieved an RMSE of 1.3058 -- lower than the baselines, but interpretable.

%p We used the baseline correction to retrain a Lasso regression model. We further split the training dataset to be used to build a history of user's reviews. The problem that was incurred here is that we needed to sacrifice half of the training data to purely use in building this history metric, however, this formed a strong predictor and a resultant RMSE of 1.240 was achieved.
